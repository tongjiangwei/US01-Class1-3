    "Bran's bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. \"Keep the pony well in hand,\" he whispered. \"And don't look away. Father will know if you do.\"\n",
    "\tBran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away.\n",
    "\tHis father took off the man's head with a single sure stroke. Blood sprayed out across the snow, as red as summerwine. One of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting. Bran could not take his eyes off the blood. The snows around the stump drank it eagerly, reddening as he watched.\n",
    "\tThe head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy's feet. Theon was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away.\n",
    "\t\"Ass,\" Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran's shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard brother. \"You did well,\" Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice.\n",
    "\tIt seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky. Bran rode with his brothers, well ahead of the main party, his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses.\n",
    "\t\"The deserter died bravely,\" Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother's coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. \"He had courage, at the least.\"\n",
    "\t\"No,\" Jon Snow said quietly. \"It was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his eyes, Stark.\" Jon's eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.\n",
    "\tRobb was not impressed. \"The Others take his eyes,\" he swore. \"He died well. Race you to the bridge?\"\n",
    "\t\"Done,\" Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went.\n",
    "\tBran did not try to follow. His pony could not keep up. He had seen the ragged man's eyes, and he was thinking of them now. After a while, the sound of Robb's laughter receded, and the woods grew silent again.\n",
    "\tSo deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride beside him. \"Are you well, Bran?\" he asked, not unkindly.\n",
    "\t\"Yes, Father,\" Bran told him. He looked up. Wrapped in his furs and leathers, mounted on his great warhorse, his lord father loomed over him like a giant. \"Robb says the man died bravely, but Jon says he was afraid.\"\n",
    "\t\"What do you think?\" his father asked.\n",
    "\tBran thought about it. \"Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?\"\n",
    "\t\"That is the only time a man can be brave,\" his father told him. \"Do you understand why I did it?\"\n",
    "\t\"He was a wildling,\" Bran said. \"They carry off women and sell them to the Others.\"\n",
    "\tHis lord father smiled. \"Old Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the Night's Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was not why the man had to die, but why I must do it.\"\n",
    "\tBran had no answer for that. \"King Robert has a headsman,\" he said, uncertainly.\n",
    "\t\"He does,\" his father admitted. \"As did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man's life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.\n",
    "\t\"One day, Bran, you will be Robb's bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.\"\n",
    "\tThat was when Jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them. He waved and shouted down at them. \"Father, Bran, come quickly, see what Robb has found!\" Then he was gone again.\n",
    "\tJory rode up beside them. \"Trouble, my lord?\"\n",
    "\t\"Beyond a doubt,\" his lord father said. \"Come, let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now.\" He sent his horse into a trot. Jory and Bran and the rest came after.\n",
    "\tThey found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with Jon still mounted beside him. The late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn. Robb stood knee-deep in white, his hood pulled back so the sun shone in his hair. He was cradling something in his arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited voices.\n",
    "\tThe riders picked their way carefully through the drifts, groping for solid footing on the hidden, uneven ground. Jory Cassel and Theon Greyjoy were the first to reach the boys. Greyjoy was laughing and joking as he rode. Bran heard the breath go out of him. \"Gods!\" he exclaimed, struggling to keep control of his horse as he reached for his sword.\n",
    "\tJory's sword was already out. \"Robb, get away from it!\" he called as his horse reared under him.\n",
    "\tRobb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms. \"She can't hurt you,\" he said. \"She's dead, Jory.\"\n",
    "\tBran was afire with curiosity by then. He would have spurred the pony faster, but his father made them dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot. Bran jumped off and ran.\n",
    "\tBy then Jon, Jory, and Theon Greyjoy had all dismounted as well. \"What in the seven hells is it?\" Greyjoy was saying.\n",
    "\t\"A wolf,\" Robb told him.\n",
    "\t\"A freak,\" Greyjoy said. \"Look at the size of it.\"\n",
    "\tBran's heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waist-high drift to his brothers' side.\n",
    "\tHalf-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman's perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It was bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father's kennel.\n",
    "\t\"It's no freak,\" Jon said calmly. \"That's a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind.\"\n",
    "\tTheon Greyjoy said, \"There's not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.\"\n",
    "\t\"I see one now,\" Jon replied.\n",
    "\tBran tore his eyes away from the monster. That was when he noticed the bundle in Robb's arms. He gave a cry of delight and moved closer. The pup was a tiny ball of grey-black fur, its eyes still closed. It nuzzled blindly against Robb's chest as he cradled it, searching for milk among his leathers, making a sad little whimpery sound. Bran reached out hesitantly. \"Go on,\" Robb told him. \"You can touch him.\"\n",
    "\tBran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke, then turned as Jon said, \"Here you go.\" His half brother put a second pup into his arms. \"There are five of them.\" Bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup to his face. Its fur was soft and warm against his cheek.\n",
    "\t\"Direwolves loose in the realm, after so many years,\" muttered Hullen, the master of horse. \"I like it not.\"\n",
    "\t\"It is a sign,\" Jory said.\n",
    "\tFather frowned. \"This is only a dead animal, Jory,\" he said. Yet he seemed troubled. Snow crunched under his boots as he moved around the body. \"Do we know what killed her?\"\n",
    "\t\"There's something in the throat,\" Robb told him, proud to have found the answer before his father even asked. \"There, just under the jaw.\"\n",
    "\tHis father knelt and groped under the beast's head with his hand. He gave a yank and held it up for all to see. A foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all wet with blood.\n",
    "\tA sudden silence descended over the party. The men looked at the antler uneasily, and no one dared to speak. Even Bran could sense their fear, though he did not understand.\n",
    "\tHis father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow. \"I'm surprised she lived long enough to whelp,\" he said. His voice broke the spell.\n",
    "\t\"Maybe she didn't,\" Jory said. \"I've heard tales ... maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups came.\"\n",
    "\t\"Born with the dead,\" another man put in. \"Worse luck.\"\n",
    "\t\"No matter,\" said Hullen. \"They be dead soon enough too.\"\n",
    "\tBran gave a wordless cry of dismay.\n",
    "\t\"The sooner the better,\" Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. \"Give the beast here, Bran.\"\n",
    "\tThe little thing squirmed against him, as if it heard and understood. \"No!\" Bran cried out fiercely. \"It's mine.\"\n",
    "\t\"Put away your sword, Greyjoy,\" Robb said. For a moment he sounded as commanding as their father, like the lord he would someday be. \"We will keep these pups.\"\n",
    "\t\"You cannot do that, boy,\" said Harwin, who was Hullen's son.\n",
    "\t\"It be a mercy to kill them,\" Hullen said.\n",
    "\tBran looked to his lord father for rescue, but got only a frown, a furrowed brow. \"Hullen speaks truly, son. Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation.\"\n",
    "\t\"No!\" He could feel tears welling in his eyes, and he looked away. He did not want to cry in front of his father.\n",
    "\tRobb resisted stubbornly. \"Ser Rodrik's red bitch whelped again last week,\" he said. \"It was a small litter, only two live pups. She'll have milk enough.\"\n",
    "\t\"She'll rip them apart when they try to nurse.\"\n",
    "\t\"Lord Stark,\" Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with desperate hope. \"There are five pups,\" he told Father. \"Three male, two female.\"\n",
    "\t\"What of it, Jon?\"\n",
    "\t\"You have five trueborn children,\" Jon said. \"Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.\"\n",
    "\tBran saw his father's face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.\n",
    "\tTheir father understood as well. \"You want no pup for yourself, Jon?\" he asked softly.\n",
    "\t\"The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,\" Jon pointed out. \"I am no Stark, Father.\"\n",
    "\tTheir lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully. Robb rushed into the silence he left. \"I will nurse him myself, Father,\" he promised. \"I will soak a towel with warm milk, and give him suck from that.\"\n",
    "\t\"Me too!\" Bran echoed.\n",
    "\tThe lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes. \"Easy to say, and harder to do. I will not have you wasting the servants' time with this. If you want these pups, you will feed them yourselves. Is that understood?\"\n",
    "\tBran nodded eagerly. The pup squirmed in his grasp, licked at his face with a warm tongue.\n",
    "\t\"You must train them as well,\" their father said. \"You must train them. The kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monsters, I promise you that. And the gods help you if you neglect them, or brutalize them, or train them badly. These are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick. A direwolf will rip a man's arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat. Are you sure you want this?\"\n",
    "\t\"Yes, Father,\" Bran said.\n",
    "\t\"Yes,\" Robb agreed.\n",
    "\t\"The pups may die anyway, despite all you do.\"\n",
    "\t\"They won't die,\" Robb said. \"We won't let them die.\"\n",
    "\t\"Keep them, then. Jory, Desmond, gather up the other pups. It's time we were back to Winterfell.\"\n",
    "\tIt was not until they were mounted and on their way that Bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of victory. By then, his pup was snuggled inside his leathers, warm against him, safe for the long ride home. Bran was wondering what to name him.\n",
    "\tHalfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly.\n",
    "\t\"What is it, Jon?\" their lord father asked.\n",
    "\t\"Can't you hear it?\"\n",
    "\tBran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else.\n",
    "\t\"There,\" Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling.\n",
    "\t\"He must have crawled away from the others,\" Jon said.\n",
    "\t\"Or been driven away,\" their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.\n",
    "\t\"An albino,\" Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. \"This one will die even faster than the others.\"\n",
    "\tJon Snow gave his father's ward a long, chilling look. \"I think not, Greyjoy,\" he said. \"This one belongs to me.\"\n",
